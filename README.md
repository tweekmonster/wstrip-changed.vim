# wstrip-changed.vim

Strip trailing whitespace only on changed lines.  Inspired by question on
StackExchange's [Vi and Vim][1] website.


## Summary

This plugin provides a command that runs a `diff` of the buffer against the
buffer's existing file.  Only new lines are checked for trailing whitespace.


## Usage

The `StripChangedWhitespace` can be used manually or with an `autocmd`:

```vim
autocmd BufWritePre *.py StripChangedWhitespace
```

With the `autocmd` above, writing a file will strip whitespace from changed
lines.  If you want to preserve trailing whitespace, you can ignore the
`autocmd` by typing `:noa w` in the command line.  The next `:w` should leave
the trailing whitespace as long as nothing else on that line is changed.
